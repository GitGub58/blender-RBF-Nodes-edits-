# Add-ons for Blender

This is a free add-on collection for Blender which will be extended over time as production calls for the creation of new tools.

Feel free to download and use any available.

## Place Reflection
Perform a reflection-based placement of lights (or any other object) on a mesh by simply dragging the mouse over the mesh.
