# Add-ons for Blender

This is a free add-on collection for Blender which will be extended over time as production calls for the creation of new tools.
It basically copies the default pickwalking behaviour of Maya with additional selection extension and opposite side switching.

Feel free to download and use any available.

## PickWalk
Navigate through a hierarchy of objects or bones of an armature or walk over vertices and points of meshes and curves in edit mode.

## Place Reflection
Perform a reflection-based placement of lights (or any other object) on a mesh by simply dragging the mouse over the mesh.

## Tool Shelf
Save scripts as buttons and organize them in groups for easy access.
